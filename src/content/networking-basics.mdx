# Networking Basics

## Definition

When sending mail in the real world, we need a From and To address. In the digital world, we need a Source and Destination address.

WHen sending data over the network, the rules are called Internet Protocol (IP). Hence, why we call computer addresses IP addresses.

Computer are going to send packets of data to each other. Each packet will contain metadata such as the source and destination address, 
and the data itself. The IP Header is the metadata that is sent with the packet.

```
IP Header:
- Source Address
- Destination Address
- Protocol
- Data
```

The IP Header is a fixed size of 20 bytes.

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a protocol that is used to send data over the network.

1. IP Header. Transport Layer
2. TCP Header: Sequence Number(Ex: Sending a file of 1000 bytes, the sequence number will be 1000). Network Layer
3. Application Data: The actual data that is being sent. Ex: HTTP Request. Application Layer
