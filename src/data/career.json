        "Authored framework-agnostic TypeScript packages, enforcing strict test coverage, comprehensive documentation, and automated CI/CD pipelines. This decentralized logic, effectively removing the CVS Shop team as an integration middleman and empowering external teams to ship independently.",

        "Partnered with a Staff Engineer to design a unified GraphQL schema for CVS Shop pages, shifting data aggregation to the server to improve client consistency. Implemented a custom adapter pattern to normalize data, enabling a phased migration that reduced client-side round-trips with zero service interruption.",
        "Built third-party ad integrations by defining strict API contracts to maximize user data telemetry and tracking. Implemented React logic that leveraged these data signals to deliver relevant, targeted advertising without compromising frontend performance.",
        "Collaborated in defining the team's next-generation tech stack, prioritizing development experience and page speed. Validated the architecture by migrating the high-traffic Product Detail Page, replacing legacy Express/Redux logic to improve page speed and developer velocity."

        "Pitched and spearheaded the digital transformation of a legacy paper-based procurement system into a unified web platform. By digitizing manual workflows, I provided ownership with their first-ever centralized data history, enabling accurate demand forecasting and real-time visibility into cost fluctuations during a period of expansion.",
        "Solely architected and built Mise, a full-stack ERP system, using Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. Independently developed the end-to-end infrastructure, including a normalized database schema and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions across multiple store locations.",
        "Engineered a snappy, user-friendly experience by implementing optimistic updates for instant UI feedback and strategic loading fallbacks. Optimized frontend performance to handle 100+ line-item forms without input lag and authored all training documentation to ensure a successful staff transition."
